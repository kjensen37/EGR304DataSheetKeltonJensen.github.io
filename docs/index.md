## Introduction

* This data sheet exists to explain the subsection of the main hub microcontroller sending and recieving analog and digital signals from all other teamates PCB boards for the plant monitoring system.

### Project Summary
---
* Our EGR 304 project is to create a household device that uses sensors and actuators to help streamline a process, save resources, or eliminate manual steps. The goal our our device, the Plant Monitoring System, is to monitor and automate watering of indoor plants. My portion of the project covers most of the reciving and sending information from board to board.

### My Contribution
---
My role of my main hub system is to transmit and recive digital and analog signals gathered by my teamates sensors, to then display them on a 16x2 LCD screen along with a rotary encoder able to alternate menus to display different subsystem informaton recieved.
