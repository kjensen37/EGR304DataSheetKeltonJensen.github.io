## Introduction

* This data sheet exists to explain the subsection of the main hub microcontroller sending and recieving analog and digital signals from all other teamates PCB boards for the plant monitoring system.

### Project Summary

* Our EGR 304 project is to create a household device that uses sensors and actuators to help streamline a process, save resources, or eliminate manual steps. The goal our our device, the Plant Monitoring System, is to monitor and automate watering of indoor plants. My portion of the project covers most of the reciving and sending information from board to board.

### My Contribution

* This needs to be updated to reflect a team introduction
* Content should also help an unfamiliar reader navigate to areas of interest. Information like:

To review the details listed of the material used to construct the subsection, you can review it in the ["BOM"](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/EGR304DataSheetTemplate/03-BOM/BOM/) section of the datasheet.
