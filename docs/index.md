## Introduction

* This data sheet exists to explain the subsection of the main hub microcontroller sending and recieving analog and digital signals from all other teamates PCB boards for the plant monitoring system.

### Project Summary

* Our EGR 304 project is to create a household device that uses sensors and actuators to help streamline a process, save resources, or eliminate manual steps. The goal our our device, the Plant Monitoring System, is to monitor and automate watering of indoor plants. My portion of the project covers most of the reciving and sending information from board to board.

### My Contribution

My role of my main hub system is to transmit and recive digital and analog signals gathered by my teamates sensors, to then display them on a 16x2 LCD screen along with a rotary encoder able to alternate menus to display different subsystem informaton recieved. 

To review the concept diagram of the subsystem detailing its major components, power levels, and connections, navigate to the [Block Diagram](https://kjensen37.github.io/EGR304DataSheetKeltonJensen.github.io/01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram) section of the datasheet.

To review the concept diagram of the subsystem and its connections, navigate to the [Component Selection](https://kjensen37.github.io/EGR304DataSheetKeltonJensen.github.io/02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection) section of the datasheet.

To review the details listed of the material used to construct the subsystem, navigate to the [BOM](https://kjensen37.github.io/EGR304DataSheetKeltonJensen.github.io/03-BOM/BOM) section of the datasheet.

To review the concept diagram of the subsystem and its connections, navigate to the [Schematic](https://kjensen37.github.io/EGR304DataSheetKeltonJensen.github.io/04-Schematic/schematic) section of the datasheet.

To review the concept diagram of the subsystem and its connections, navigate to the [Power Budget](https://kjensen37.github.io/EGR304DataSheetKeltonJensen.github.io/05-Power-Budget/Power-Budget) section of the datasheet.

To review any additional information, navigate to the [Appendix](https://kjensen37.github.io/EGR304DataSheetKeltonJensen.github.io/Appendix) section of the datasheet.
