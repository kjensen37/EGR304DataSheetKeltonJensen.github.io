## Hardware V2.0

My hardware was relativly all in working condition. There are a couple of quality of life changes that I would like to make to improve not only ease of soldering and installing parts but also giving myself more space for components. The following are some of the changes that I would make.

**More space for my teamates 8-pin connectors:** I had not realized the dimensions of the 8-pin connector so therefore I allowed to little space for each connector to sit properly on my board. For our final presentation I had to use 8 female to male jumpers for one of the connectors purely becuase one interfered with the connection of the other. This was very inconvenient but not an immediate failure as we were able to remedy it.

**Custom footprints not correct:** For two of my components, the rotary encoder and the potentiometer, I made an error in the dimensions of the through hole footprint, causing it to not fit whatsoever. To fix this I had to solder male headers in my board, then I used female to female jumpers to connect both components which was inconvenient but not a insolvable error.

**Larger through hole size for fuses:** For both fuses on my board I utilized a fuse holder, when I finally recieved the fuse holder component I didnt take into account the size of the through hole component. I believed that they would be very standard size not realizing that they were thicker. To fix this I had to solder 4 female headers in total to slot in my fuse holders. Again very inconvenient but not unsolvable.

**Adding a silkscreen:** My teamates and I were getting a lot of silkscreen errors on our JLCDFM checker. We all made the excecutive descision to completely disregard our silkscreens to accelerate manfucaturing. A good decision for the situation the class was put in but for next time a silkscreen would be a tremendous help with locating where different components of the same family, like resistors with different values are supposed to be placed.

**LCD footprint:** The LCD footprint that I used worked but I had a lot of the connections out of line causing my to have to criss cross wires and make a confusing rats nest of connections. A heavy inconvenience especially when I had to disconnect and reconnect but overal a very solvable problem.

**More test points:** I remember listening to my professor talking about how you can never have enough test points / debugging LED's and I took that wisdom for granted. Especially when getting everything set up and powered for the first time it wouldve saved me a lot of hastle if I had more debugging tools for both hardware and software.

These are all of the possible adjustments for my PCB board. With these improvements the board would be more accesable and easier to manufacutre
