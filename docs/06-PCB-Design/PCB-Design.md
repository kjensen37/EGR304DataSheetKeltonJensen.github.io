## Overview
The PCB desing contains every component used from the schematic. All components are through hole allowing me to easily connect and disconnect every component. I will be using female to female wires for some of the connections from my teamates to my microcontroller. For the LCD I will be using a ribbon cable so it will not be surface mounted on the PCB itself.
