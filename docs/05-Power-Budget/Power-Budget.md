title: Power Budget
---

## Overview
The point of this power budget is to note the power requirements of each component within my system to ensure functionality across all components. All of my components can be placed on the +5V power rail. My +5V power rail will be regulated by the LM7805 voltage regulator. With all of the information provided below I am able to supply enough current with a 25% safety margin.

## Conclusions

From the prepare Power Budget, my team and I were able to conlcude that using the 9V wall adapter gives all of us enough power and current to supply each of our boards. We also have some extra availible current and power for expansion if necessary.
